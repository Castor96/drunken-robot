Hi scrublords!

I'm xXx_swag_scoper_420_xXx and this is the official drunken-robot readme file! If you feel like you've hit rock bottom socially right now, you're absolutely correct! I mean, what kind of faggot does someone have to be, to read this stupid bullshit and waste his time with some random readme file. But evidently you don't give a fuck, since you're still reading this but if you really want to stay, well, here are some random facts for you:
